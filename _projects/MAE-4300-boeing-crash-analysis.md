Ethical Analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX Crashes

The Boeing 737 MAX crashes highlight why engineering ethics is essential to preventing catastrophic failures in complex technological systems. At the core of this case is a conflict between profit-driven decision making and the engineer’s ethical duty to protect public safety. Boeing’s actions raise serious concerns regarding multiple principles of the ASME Code of Ethics, demonstrating how ethical lapses at the individual, organizational, and regulatory levels can lead to loss of life.

Profit vs. Public Safety

ASME Principle 1 states that engineers must “hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” In the development of the 737 MAX, Boeing prioritized cost-cutting and rapid market competitiveness over safety. The company faced intense competition from Airbus and sought to maximize profit by minimizing pilot retraining costs and accelerating certification. These financial motivations directly influenced engineering decisions, including design changes and limited disclosure of safety-critical systems. Placing profit above safety violated the most fundamental ethical obligation of engineers and engineering organizations.

Withholding Information and Lack of Transparency

Boeing’s decision to withhold information about the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) from pilots and the public represents a clear ethical failure. Pilots were not informed that MCAS existed, nor were they adequately trained on how to respond if it malfunctioned. ASME Principle 7 emphasizes honesty, transparency, and avoiding deceptive acts. By removing references to MCAS from pilot manuals and training materials to reduce costs, Boeing denied pilots critical knowledge that could have saved lives. In safety-critical systems, information is not optional—it is essential for public safety.

Failure to Test and Verify Safety

ASME Principle 3 requires engineers to issue objective and truthful statements and to ensure that designs are safe through proper testing. Boeing relied on a single angle-of-attack (AOA) sensor to activate MCAS rather than using redundant sensors, increasing the risk of failure. Additionally, MCAS was granted greater control authority than initially disclosed to regulators. More rigorous testing and transparent communication would likely have revealed these vulnerabilities and prompted corrective action before the aircraft entered service.

Inequitable Impact and Global Responsibility

Notably, the crashes occurred in developing countries, raising ethical concerns related to ASME Principle 2, which emphasizes fairness and equity. This raises the question of whether Boeing adequately considered how the aircraft would perform in different operational environments and whether training and support were consistent across regions. Ethical engineering demands equal standards of safety regardless of geographic location or economic status.

Design Decisions and Engineering Judgment

Boeing’s decision to place larger engines on an airframe not originally designed for them introduced aerodynamic instability, necessitating MCAS in the first place. ASME Principle 5 requires engineers to build their reputation on merit and sound engineering judgment. Designing around market constraints rather than redesigning the aircraft to safely accommodate new engines reflects compromised professional judgment driven by business pressures.

Silence and Professional Responsibility 

Another critical ethical question is why engineers did not speak up. ASME Principle 6 stresses the responsibility to act when public safety is at risk. Internal reports later revealed that safety concerns were not treated with the required seriousness, indicating a corporate culture that discouraged dissent. Decades of organizational decision-making eroded Boeing’s safety culture, creating “deep fractures in safety management systems” where engineers felt unable or unwilling to challenge management decisions.

Qualifications, Oversight, and Regulatory Failure 

ASME Principle 10 requires engineers to uphold the integrity of the profession. Questions remain about whether engineers involved were empowered and supported to act ethically and whether Boeing complied with professional standards. Additionally, the FAA bears responsibility for insufficient regulatory oversight. Boeing’s ability to self-certify aspects of the aircraft reduced independent scrutiny, allowing critical issues to go unaddressed. Proper regulatory screening and accountability could have prevented the crashes.

Moving Forward

The Boeing 737 MAX crashes were not the result of a single technical failure but rather a systemic ethical breakdown involving corporate priorities, engineering decisions, and regulatory oversight. By violating multiple ASME ethical principles, Boeing demonstrated how ethical lapses can have fatal consequences. Studying this case is essential for engineers to understand that ethical responsibility does not end with technical competence; it requires the courage to prioritize safety, speak up against unethical practices, and ensure that engineering serves the public good above all else.
In our careers, we should proceed by consistently placing public safety, transparency, and integrity above profit, convenience, or organizational pressure. The Boeing 737 MAX crashes show that ethical failures often arise not from a lack of technical knowledge, but from decisions made when financial goals conflict with safety. As engineers, we must ensure that systems are thoroughly tested, risks are clearly communicated, and critical information is never withheld from users or the public. We have a responsibility to speak up when we identify safety concerns, even when doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular, and to advocate for ethical decision-making within our organizations. Additionally, we must recognize that engineering solutions impact people globally and strive to uphold the same safety standards across all environments and populations. By adhering to professional codes of ethics and maintaining a strong moral compass, we can help prevent tragedies like the Boeing crashes and ensure that engineering serves the public good rather than undermining it.
